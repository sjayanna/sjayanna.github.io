Sid is passionate about technology, social entrepreneurship, product development, startups and good design. I love to use technology to help improve communities.

Below are somethings which I have worked or working on.

## Giving Foundation for Children - [supportGFC.org](https://supportGFC.org)

supportGFC is a social entrepreneurial initiative supporting children with special needs in the United States and around the world. Check out the technology platform which I help architect, design and develop along with a team. The link is [Giving Foundation for Children](https://supportGFC.org). I continue to support this organization as a technology advisor and member of the Board.

## Technical Mentor @ [CoderDojo](http://www.shcoderdojo.org)

I volunteer at Safety Harbor CoderDojo as a mentor helping young children learn coding and problem solving. I also help the local chapter setup their coderdojo website and provide input/create lesson plans for the various coding programs they conduct. I encourage my young daughters to learn coding and believe all children need to be exposed to it. Hopefully some might be interested/motivated and pursue a technical career. If you like to be a mentor, check out the CoderDojo [website](http://coderdojo.com)
