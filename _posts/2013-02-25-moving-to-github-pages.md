I have been a bit private about blogging usually keeping private entries, I have decided that I should start sharing interesting articles I have read or useful piece of code or application that I have written or used. This will help me find that information easily and also might help someone on the www.

I have used blogger in the past but decided to go with [github pages](http://pages.github.com/) due to the ease of use and also due to a nice application in [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) which helps with creating blog entries.

In the next few days I will be importing some of my old posts onto this new site.
