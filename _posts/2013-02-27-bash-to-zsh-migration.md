I have been reading the power of [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/FAQ/) for a while and finally decided to transition away from bash shell.
[Railscasts](http://railscasts.com/episodes/308-oh-my-zsh) has a nice episode on transitioning to zsh using [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

zsh has great command completion, for example:

	kill <tab> # gives a list of all the processes with pid unlike bash shell.

zsh has good command typo correction and a lot more. Please read the [zsh manual](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/zsh_toc.html).
