Phoenix is a web development framework
for the Elixir language.
In this tutorial,
we will build multiple small web apps
to explore the framework.

Some of the reasons
you might want to try out Phoenix are:

* **Concurrency**:
  Elixir runs on top of Erlang's virtual machine,
  which allows you to write massively concurrent applications
* **Realtime features**:
  Phoenix tries to make
  building realtime applications
  as easy as building
  your typical web app.

Phoenix creator, Chris McCord
explains the pros and cons
of Phoenix

_In the
[next section](/notes/phoenix/installation/),
we will install Phoenix
and generate a barebones application._
