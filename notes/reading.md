### On finding time to read

_I occasionally get emails asking how I manage to find time to read.
This is my usual reply:_

Finding time for reading usually means finding ways to convince myself
to move reading higher up my list of priorities.
Here are a few ideas/mind hacks that encourage me to do that:

* Keep a book with you all the time.
  I always carry a book with me when I go out,
  so if I'm waiting somewhere, it helps avoids boredom,
  and allows some progress with a book.
* I keep the phone in the next room when I'm reading,
  so I'm not interrupted by WhatApp messages every few minutes.
* I buy more books than I can read right now.
  (There are about 30 unread books with me now.)
  Having multiple options allows me to pick
  whatever I'm feeling like reading right now.
* I often read multiple books in parallel -
  if I'm stuck and not in the mood to read one book,
  I can quickly switch to something else.
  I try to make the books as different as possible
  (like one novel and a programming book, or fiction + non-fiction).
